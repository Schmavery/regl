ReGL
---
Simple bindings to opengl 2.0 and webgl.

This library exposes bindings to both webgl and opengl to be used from Reason.
[ReWitness](https://github.com/bsansouci/rewitness) is a big example project using those bindings.

All of the method names are taken directly from opengl, and their docs should apply.
