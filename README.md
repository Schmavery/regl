ReGL
---
Simple bindings to opengl 2.0 and webgl.

This library exposes bindings to both webgl and opengl to be used from Reason.

If you want to get started quickly, check out [ReglExampleProject](https://github.com/bsansouci/reglexampleproject). It's a great starting point to any project using `ReGl` and a simple tutorial.

[ReWitness](https://github.com/bsansouci/rewitness) is a big example project using those bindings.

All of the method names are taken directly from opengl, and their docs should apply.
